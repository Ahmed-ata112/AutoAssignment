## AutoAssignment

A simple script to make the Pins assignment instead of using the Quartus Assignment Editor with DE0-CV board

## How to use

you can find all the the supported pins in the `pins.txt`
file
it supports mainly 2 modes

- Excel Mode Where You Can just list all the pins as a table in the `input.xlsx`
- interactive mode where you can assign the pins one after the other

And find the output at the `output.txt` file and just copy it to the `.qsf` of your Quartus Project
